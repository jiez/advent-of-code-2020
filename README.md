1. set in C++ is ordered. set does not have intersection or union method.
   It uses std::set\_intersection and std::set\_union.


Day 12
------

If a vector [a b]' turns clockwise A degree to get [x y]', we have

x = a cosA + b sinA

y = - a sinA + b cosA


Day 14
------

-Wconversion will be useful for catch conversion bugs.
It is not enabled by -Wall or -Wextra.


Day 17
------

How to Create a generic solution for 3-D and 4-D ?

How about using unordered_map? Will it improve performance?

Add constructor to some struct types to see if it can simplify code.
